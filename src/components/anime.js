          <h3>About</h3><p>My Favorite Anime is NARUTO.Naruto is a Japanese manga series written and illustrated by Masashi Kishimoto. It tells the story of Naruto Uzumaki, a young ninja who seeks recognition from his peers and dreams of becoming the Hokage, the leader of his village. The story is told in two partsâ€”the first set in Naruto's pre-teen years, and the second in his teens. </p>
